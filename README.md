Redfin Real Estate Scraper

 Project Description

Redfin Real Estate Scraper is a tool designed for automatically retrieving data from the Redfin website. It allows users to select a city of interest, and the scraper will visit each real estate listing in the chosen city, extracting the following information:

- Address
- Street
- Property Price
- Property Size
- Number of Parking Spaces
- Garden Size
- Price per Square Foot
- Number of Bathrooms
- Number of Bedrooms
- Real Estate Agent's Contact Information
- Link to the Listing
- Days the Listing Has Been on the Platform
- Year the Property Was Built
- Property Description

The collected data is automatically saved to a Google Sheets spreadsheet, allowing users to create a database of current listings in the selected city. The tool can be configured to run at specific intervals, adding the latest listings to the database. This solution is ideal for saving time and money by automating the data collection process from the Redfin website.

 Expansion and Integration Possibilities

The tool can be expanded and integrated with other systems, providing a wide range of usefulness. It can be connected with other automation processes where tools complement each other, creating comprehensive solutions. For example, the Redfin scraper can be integrated with a chatbot that, based on the collected data, can select several properties that meet specific criteria. This integration allows for the creation of dynamic and intelligent systems that significantly facilitate the management of real estate information.

 Benefits

With this tool, users can automatically collect and update real estate data from the Redfin website, enabling continuous monitoring of the real estate market in the selected city. The ability to customize the tool and its integration with other systems makes it extremely flexible, capable of meeting even the most demanding scenarios.
